## 1. Security Policy Overview

This document details the security policy for this project. It is designed for reporting **critical security vulnerabilities** that could negatively inpact users, contributors, collaborators, the project itself, the repository owner/maintainer, and everyone else involved significantly.

### Key Points:

- **Purpose:** To provide a clear process for reporting critical security issues.
- **Focus:** **Critical Security Vulnerabilities** only.
- **Not for:** General bugs or feature requests. Use the standard issue tracker for those.

## 2. How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a critical security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Keep it Private:** **Do not publicly disclose** the vulnerability.
2. **Direct Contact:** Reach out to us directly via `Vulnerability Disclosure Form`.
3. **Report Details:** Include the following information in your report:
   - **Clear Description:** A concise explanation of the vulnerability.
   - **Reproduction Steps:** Detailed steps to recreate the vulnerability.
   - **Potential Impact:** Describe the possible harm the vulnerability could cause.
   - **Supporting Materials:** Attach any relevant files like screenshots, code snippets, or proof-of-concept.
   - **Contact Information:** Your contact details (optional, if you wish to be contacted).

## 3. How We Handle Security Reports

Our process for handling security reports:

1. **Acknowledgement:** We will confirm receipt of your report within **24-48 hours**.
2. **Investigation:** We will thoroughly examine the vulnerability and assess its potential impact.
3. **Solution Development:** We will prioritize developing and releasing a patch or fix as quickly as possible.
4. **Communication:** We will keep you informed about our progress in resolving the issue.
5. **Recognition (Optional):** With your permission, we may publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure.

## 4. What is a Security Issue?
>  [!note]
> - A **critical security issue** is something that includes, but is not limited to, the following. 
> - If an issue is not mentioned but you believe it poses a security risk, **please do report** it.

- **Compromises Confidentiality:** Could lead to unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data like:
  - API keys
  - User credentials
  - Personal data
- **Enables Malicious Actions:** Could allow an attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary code on the system.
  - Launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack to disrupt service.
  - Bypass security restrictions.
  - Create a new attack vector.
  - Turn the project into a harmful or dangerous environment.
- **Causes Data Leaks:** Includes unintentional exposure of important data.
- **Risks User Systems:** Anything that could put a user's computer or data at risk.

### 4.1 Examples of Security Issues

- Exposed API keys or login credentials.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities.

### 4.2 Not Security Issues (Report as Regular Issues)

- Minor visual (UI) bugs.
- Performance slowdowns that don't create a security risk.
- Suggestions for new features or improvements.

## 5. Security Best Practices for Everyone

To help maintain security:

- **Command Awareness:** Understand the commands you are executing.
- **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your systems and software.
- **Link & Attachment Caution:** Be wary of clicking on suspicious links or opening unexpected attachments.
- **Immediate Reporting:** If you suspect any security incident, report it right away.
- **Development Environment:** Work in a dedicated and controlled environment specifically for development.

### 5.1 For Developers

- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions.
- **Input Sanitization:** Clean and validate all user inputs to prevent attacks.
- **Follow Security Practices:** Implement standard security best practices during development.

## 6. Legal and Ethical Points

Important considerations for security reporting:

- **Responsible Disclosure:** It is crucial to report vulnerabilities privately and allow us time to fix them before public disclosure.
- **No Unauthorized Exploitation:** Attempting to exploit security issues without permission is illegal and unethical.
- **Collaboration is Valued:** We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure for everyone.
- **Production Environment Prohibition:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in a live production environment without explicit consent is strictly forbidden.
- **Dummy Data in Reports:** When submitting reports, do not include real sensitive data. Replace any sensitive information with fake or dummy data for examples.

## 7. Scope of this Policy

This policy covers all parts of this project:

- **Source Code:** All code within the repository.
- **Websites:** Project websites and web applications.
- **APIs:** Application Programming Interfaces.
- **Documentation:** All project documentation.

## 8. Policy Updates

**Policy Changes:** This security policy may be updated periodically as per need, Please check back here for the most current version of the policy.
